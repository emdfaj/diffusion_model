# Diffusion Models for Gravitational Wave Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains my work on creating and training diffusion models for analyzing gravitational waves. Initially, the diffusion model was trained on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits. Subsequently, I developed a custom dataset specifically for gravitational wave noise and trained the diffusion model using this data.

## Features

- **Diffusion Models**: Implementation of diffusion models capable of generating and analyzing complex data distributions.
- **Image Generation**: Trained on the MNIST dataset to demonstrate the capability of generating high-quality images.
- **Gravitational Wave Noise Dataset**: Custom code for generating a dataset that simulates gravitational wave noise for model training and testing.

## Datasets

### MNIST Dataset

- **Description**: The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits and serves as a benchmark for image generation tasks.
- **Usage**: The initial diffusion model was trained on this dataset to validate the implementation and understand its behavior in generating images.

### Gravitational Wave Noise Dataset

- **Description**: This dataset is generated using a custom Python script included in this repository. It simulates gravitational wave noise for training the diffusion model.
- **Code**: The code for generating the gravitational wave noise dataset is located in `generate_gravitational_wave_noise.py`.

## Models Included

- **Diffusion Model on MNIST**: Code and results from training the diffusion model on the MNIST dataset.
- **Diffusion Model on Gravitational Wave Noise**: Implementation of the diffusion model trained using the gravitational wave noise dataset.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diffusion-models.git
   cd diffusion-models
   ```
## Installation

To set up this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your implementation)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib


## Customization Notes

- **Repository Links**: Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username in the clone command.
- **Model Training Scripts**: Ensure that the script names (e.g., `train_diffusion_model.py`) match the actual names in your repository.
- **Libraries**: Adjust the required libraries section according to your specific implementation (e.g., whether you are using TensorFlow or PyTorch).
- **Additional Information**: Feel free to add sections such as results or specific instructions for training and testing the models based on your project's needs.
